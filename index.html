      <div class="text">hey friends... welcome to 'notes to self!'<br>this project was borne out of a desire i think a lot of writers &amp; artists experience. we write a lot of works (in my case, songs) that we love, ones that may be deeply personal &amp; important to us, but only ever to release a small fraction of them. this can be for a variety of reasons- maybe they don't fit your genre, a project's themes, a release schedule- the list goes on &amp; on. this collection of songs is my temporary solution to this: intimate and sparse acoustic demos of a few favorite songs that never fit on any project. some ar story songs i wrote myself into, some are unfiltered musical journal entries, some are musings on philosophy of a girl becoming a woman; there's no set sound or theme this project follows. but one thing that unites them all is that without you listening, without 'notes to self,' they'd be just that: voice notes sitting in my phone! so thank you for giving me someone to share them with... i hope you enjoy them!<br>Amelia Day</div>
